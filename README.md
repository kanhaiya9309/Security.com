# Secure Authentication Methods Showcase

A comprehensive demonstration of secure authentication methods and user data protection in web applications. This repository contains six separate branches, each implementing a distinct authentication approach to ensure user credentials are stored and managed securely.

## Implemented Authentication Methods:

1. **Simple Username and Password Storage:**
   Basic authentication method using plain text storage.

2. **Encryption and Decryption:**
   Implementation of encryption and decryption for storing user credentials.

3. **Hash Function:**
   Usage of hash functions to secure user details.

4. **Bcrypt and Salt Rounds:**
   Integration of bcrypt hashing algorithm with salt rounds for enhanced security.

5. **Session and Cookies:**
   Utilization of sessions and cookies for user login management.

6. **Google Authentication:**
   Registration and login via Google authentication for a seamless user experience.

## Technology Stack:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, EJS templates for dynamic content rendering.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage.
- **Authentication Libraries:**
  - Bcrypt for secure password hashing.
  - Encryption and decryption for data protection.
  - Hash functions for additional security measures.
  - Passport.js (Google Strategy) for external authentication.

## How to Explore:

1. Clone the repository:

    git checkout encryption-decryption
    git checkout hash-function
    git checkout bcrypt-salt-rounds
    git checkout session-cookies
    git checkout google-authentication
    ```

3. View the commit history for each branch to understand the implementation details.
